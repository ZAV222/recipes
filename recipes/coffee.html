        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Making coffee begins with selecting your preferred coffee beans. Freshly roasted beans provide the best flavor, so choose a type that suits your taste, such as light, medium, or dark roast. Once you have your beans, grind them just before brewing to preserve their aroma and taste. The grind size depends on your brewing method: coarse for French press, medium for drip coffee makers, and fine for espresso. Next, measure the right amount of coffee grounds—usually one to two tablespoons per six ounces of water. Heat fresh, clean water to around 195–205°F (90–96°C) to ensure optimal extraction of the coffee’s flavor. Pour the water evenly over the coffee grounds, allowing them to bloom, which releases carbon dioxide and enhances the taste.

            After brewing, the coffee is ready to enjoy. You can serve it black to savor the pure flavor, or add milk, cream, or sweeteners according to your preference. For extra flavor, consider spices like cinnamon or a touch of vanilla. Different brewing methods, such as pour-over, French press, or espresso machines, can produce variations in taste and strength, giving you the flexibility to customize your cup. Always clean your equipment after use to maintain the coffee’s quality and prevent old residue from affecting future brews. With practice, you’ll be able to consistently make coffee that suits your personal taste perfectly.
